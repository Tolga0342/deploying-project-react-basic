#project: 
Recipe App

#description: Responsive recipe app created with HTML, Javascript and React + Vite. The app is styled using Chakra UI. For this project, I implemented search functionality, click interactions and return button to make the app interactive. The app consists of two pages: one screen displaying an overview of available recipes and another showing the details of a single recipe
