#project: 
Recipe App

#description: Responsive recipe app created with HTML, Javascript and React + Vite. The app is styled with Chakra-ui. For this project I implemented searchfunction, clickfunction and button to make the app interactive. The app consists of 2 pages, a screen where you can view an overview of available recipes and a screen where you can view the details of a single recipe.
